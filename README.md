# GIS
Health Authorities access the Guaranteed Income Supplement information to determine the rate of service fees to be charged to the client for certain Home Care services (Home Support or Residential Care). If a client is found to be on GIS they automatically default to the lowest rate available. Service Canada sends MOH a monthly file containing GIS information. GIS information is currently available to the Health Authorities through CCIMS.
